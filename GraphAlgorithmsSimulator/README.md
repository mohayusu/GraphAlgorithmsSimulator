# Graphing Algorithm Simulator

This is graphing simulator that was created using swift 4. Currently, the app is able to simulate Kruskal's MST algorithm and Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm. The algorthms are calculated using a cartesian distance between the points the user inserts on the graph. Points are inserted by tapping a location on the graph and are saved by their x and y coordinates on the user's screen. 

## Downloading
